- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Only if Gilbert Qui√±ones available by phone**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Scheduling around Qui√±ones' availability

**Demands & Threats:**

1. **Attorney Fees Demand: $14,473.64**
   - Payment for work through 10/15/2025
   - Additional fees to prepare DV160, DV165, DV170, DV175

üö® **"I continue to be concerned that you are discussing this case with Mia, and Jordan. That must stop."**

üö® **"You may not see it this way, as a parent involved in custody matter, but it is not good for Mia, or Jordan, to be asked questions about their Mother, or about this case, or about their conversations with social workers."**

## CASE IMPACT ANALYSIS

### IMMEDIATE CONCERNS

#### 1. **COURT ALREADY RULED - CASE DISMISSED**
- The attached minute order shows the court **DENIED** the restraining order
- Any temporary restraining order is **DISSOLVED**
- Case is **DISMISSED**
- This may explain Kirk's aggressive posture - he already won

#### 2. **MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION MAY BE MOOT**
- If case is dismissed, reconsideration may have limited effect
- Kirk knows this and is leveraging it for fee extraction

#### 3. **ATTORNEY FEES EXPOSURE: $14,473.64 + RISING**
- Kirk is demanding substantial fees
- Threatens additional fees for corrective filings
- Uses FC ¬ß271 notice as leverage
- Additional fees accruing for responding to supplemental motion

#### 4. **DCFS INFORMATION VULNERABILITY**
- Kirk repeatedly threatens to strike DCFS references
- May have legitimate grounds if Freddy improperly filed sealed/protected info
- Creates risk of sanctions, additional fees
- Could undermine credibility of entire filing

#### 5. **MINOR CHILDREN INVOLVEMENT ALLEGATION**
- Kirk accuses Freddy of discussing case with Mia & Jordan
- Frames as ethical concern
- Could escalate to Bar complaint
- Suggests consulting with Qui√±ones about propriety

#### 6. **CONDITIONAL COOPERATION**
- Kirk won't meet without Qui√±ones present
- Limits availability to Monday afternoon only
- Uses cooperation as leverage for fee/support stipulations
- Ties ¬ß1152 confidentiality to settlement discussions only

### STRATEGIC VULNERABILITIES

#### For Nuha/Freddy:

1. **Already Lost at Trial Court**
   - Restraining order denied
   - Case dismissed
   - Reconsideration is uphill battle

2. **Evidence Issues**
   - DCFS information may be improperly included
   - Minor's statements may violate confidentiality
   - Could result in sanctions

3. **Fee Exposure**
   - $14,473.64 demand is substantial
   - Kirk can add more for responding to each new filing
   - FC ¬ß271 notice creates presumption of bad faith

4. **Settlement Pressure**
   - Kirk using cooperation as lever for support stipulations
   - Linking exhibit exchange to fee concessions
   - Forcing Qui√±ones involvement adds cost/delay

5. **Professional Conduct Questions**
   - Accusation of discussing case with minors
   - Could affect Freddy's standing
   - May require response to Bar if Kirk escalates

#### For Kirk (Opposing Side Tactics):

1. **Victory Position**
   - Already won on merits
   - Using that leverage for fees/support
   - Can afford to be aggressive

2. **Fee Accumulation Strategy**
   - Every response generates billable hours
   - Threatens corrective filings (more fees)
   - Uses procedural complexity as fee multiplier

3. **Conditional Cooperation**
   - Creates obstacles to meet & confer
   - Delays resolution
   - Extracts concessions as price of discussion

4. **DCFS Angle**
   - Knows this is vulnerable point
   - Repeatedly threatens to strike
   - Uses as basis for FC ¬ß271 sanctions

---

## TACTICAL NEXT STEPS

### IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (Next 24-48 Hours)

#### 1. **ASSESS VIABILITY OF RECONSIDERATION MOTION**

**Action:** Freddy must immediately evaluate:
- What grounds exist for reconsideration after dismissal?
- Was this a final judgment or interlocutory order?
- Is there appellate path vs. reconsideration?
- What are odds of success vs. cost of pursuit?

**Decision Point:** Is continuing worth the fee exposure and risk?

**Recommendation:** 
- If case is truly dismissed, reconsideration may be dead-end
- Consider whether to:
  - **Withdraw supplemental filing** to cut losses
  - **Pivot to appeal** if grounds exist
  - **Accept dismissal** and focus on related case (25PDRO01261)

---

#### 2. **URGENT: REVIEW DCFS INFORMATION HANDLING**

**Action:** Freddy must immediately audit supplemental filing:
- What DCFS information was included?
- Was it properly handled under Welf & Inst Code ¬ß827?
- Were statements from Mia improperly disclosed?
- Are there sealing/protective order violations?

**If violations exist:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Consider voluntary withdrawal** before Kirk moves to strike
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **File corrective motion** to seal/redact
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Proactive disclosure to court** of error

**If no violations:**
- ‚úÖ **Document proper authorization** (Tyler Polk testimony, protective orders)
- ‚úÖ **Prepare opposition** to Kirk's strike motion
- ‚úÖ **Show compliance** with ¬ß827, CRC 5.552

**Recommendation:** 
- Get second opinion from DCFS/juvenile dependency specialist
- If exposure is real, cut losses now
- If position is solid, document thoroughly

---

#### 3. **ADDRESS MINOR CHILDREN DISCUSSION ALLEGATION**

**Action:** Freddy must document:
- What contact has he had with Mia & Jordan?
- Was any contact about the case vs. necessary child-welfare?
- Did he "ask questions about their Mother" or "conversations with social workers"?
- What professional conduct rules apply?

**If Kirk's allegation has merit:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Cease immediately**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Consult ethics counsel**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Document going forward**

**If allegation is false:**
- ‚úÖ **Prepare written response** with timeline
- ‚úÖ **Show any contact was proper** (represented by parent, welfare-related, etc.)
- ‚úÖ **Reserve right to sanctions** for false accusation

**Recommendation:**
- Take this seriously - Bar complaints can follow
- Don't give Kirk ammunition
- If contact was proper, affirmatively establish that

---

#### 4. **EVALUATE ATTORNEY FEES EXPOSURE**

**Action:** Analyze FC ¬ß271 risk:
- On what basis is $14,473.64 claimed?
- Is Kirk's ¬ß271 notice procedurally proper?
- What conduct allegedly justifies sanctions?
- What are odds of court awarding fees?

**Strategic calculation:**
- $14,473.64 demand now
- + Additional fees for corrective filings
- + Additional fees for supplemental motion response
- + Potential additional fees if reconsideration proceeds
- **= Potentially $20,000-30,000+ exposure**

**Recommendation:**
- If reconsideration has low success odds, consider settlement
- Offer to withdraw supplemental filing in exchange for fee waiver
- Negotiate support stipulations to avoid further litigation
- Cut losses rather than multiply fee exposure

---

#### 5. **GILBERT QUI√ëONES COORDINATION**

**Action:** Immediately contact Gilbert Qui√±ones:
- Is he available Monday afternoon?
- Will he participate in meet & confer?
- Can he run child/spousal support numbers?
- What is his assessment of case posture?

**If Qui√±ones unavailable:**
- Kirk won't meet
- Delays resolution
- Increases fees

**If Qui√±ones available:**
- Schedule immediately
- Prepare support calculations in advance
- Coordinate strategy on stipulations

**Recommendation:**
- Prioritize Qui√±ones coordination today (Saturday)
- Don't let Kirk control scheduling leverage
- If Qui√±ones can't participate, consider alternative counsel for support issues

---
