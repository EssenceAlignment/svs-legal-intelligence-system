## FINAL NOTES FOR LOVABLE AI:

This is a high-stakes family law case where bad decisions or missed details have serious consequences. The app must be:

1. **Bulletproof:** Never let an unvetted document through
2. **Intelligent:** Surface insights Eric wouldn't see manually
3. **Fast:** Can't slow down urgent decision-making
4. **Comprehensive:** One source of truth for entire case
5. **Actionable:** Every analysis leads to clear next steps

The goal is to give Eric (case manager/financial advocate) and Nuha (client) a decisive tactical advantage through superior information, analysis, and preparation. Kirk and Freddy won't know what hit them.

Build this app like it's going to be used in federal court by a white-shoe law firm. Professional, powerful, precise.

**Start with Phase 1 MVP and we'll iterate from there. Let's build something exceptional.**
